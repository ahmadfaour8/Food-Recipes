      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>11⁄16 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <p>
            Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by
            the manufacturer. Select Dough cycle; press Start.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <p>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Step 3</h3>
          <p>
            Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide
            the dough into eight equal pieces and form into rounds. Cover the rounds with
            a damp cloth and let rest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Step 4</h3>
          <p>
            Roll dough into thin flat circles, about 8 inches in diameter. Cook two at a
            time on preheated baking sheets or a baking stone until puffed up and golden
            brown, about 5 minutes. Repeat for remaining loaves.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <p>
        If you don't have a bread machine, combine 1/2 cup lukewarm water and 1/2 teaspoon
        sugar in a mixing bowl. Stir in yeast, and set aside until yeast is creamy and
        bubbly, about 5 minutes. Add remaining water, oil, salt, and flour. Mix on low
        speed using the dough hook until the gluten is fully developed, about 10 minutes.
        (You can also knead by hand on a floured surface until dough is springy and feels
        silky to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes.) Transfer dough to an oiled boil, cover with
        plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Proceed
        with the recipe as directed in Step 3.
